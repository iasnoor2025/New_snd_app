# Laravel Application Modularization Progress

## Current Status
The Laravel application is being modularized using the Nwidart Laravel Modules package. The codebase is being restructured from a monolithic Laravel application to a modules-based architecture.

## Completed Tasks
1. **Module Structure Setup**
   - Created module directories with proper structure
   - Added config files for all modules
   - Created module.json files for Nwidart module registration

2. **File Migration**
   - Moved models, controllers, and other files to appropriate module directories
   - Updated namespaces to reflect new module structure
   - Created scripts to automate the migration process

3. **Service Provider Fixes**
   - Fixed namespace issues in service providers
   - Added missing $moduleName properties
   - Created concrete implementation of abstract BaseEventHandler
   - Fixed route loading in RouteServiceProvider classes

4. **Route Organization**
   - Cleaned up route files to remove duplicates
   - Fixed syntax errors in route files
   - Ensured proper middleware usage

## PSR-4 Autoloading Fixes
Scripts were created to fix PSR-4 autoloading issues:

1. **Directory Case Standardization** (`fix_directory_case.php`)
   - Standardized directory names (config → Config, routes → Routes, etc.)
   - Ensured consistent case in subdirectories (migrations → Migrations)

2. **App Directory Structure Fix** (`fix_app_directory.php`)
   - Moved files from app/ subdirectories to proper module structure
   - Updated namespaces to reflect new locations
   - Identified and listed any remaining files in app/ directories

3. **Migration Namespace Fixes** (`fix_migration_namespaces.php`)
   - Added proper namespaces to migration files
   - Standardized namespace format (Modules\ModuleName\Database\Migrations)
   - Fixed inconsistent migration namespaces

4. **Composer.json Autoload Update** (`update_composer_autoload.php`)
   - Updated PSR-4 autoloading rules in composer.json
   - Added entries for all modules
   - Removed entries for non-existent modules

5. **Combined Fix Script** (`fix_psr4_issues.sh` and `fix_psr4_issues.bat`)
   - Created scripts to run all fixes in sequence
   - Added composer dump-autoload command to refresh autoloader

## Next Steps
1. **Testing and Validation**
   - Run comprehensive tests on the modularized application
   - Verify that all modules are loaded correctly
   - Check for any runtime errors

2. **Frontend Integration**
   - Ensure proper loading of JavaScript/React components
   - Verify asset publication and loading

3. **Documentation**
   - Update README with modularization structure
   - Document module structure and conventions
   - Create onboarding guide for new developers

## Known Issues
1. **Duplicate Files**
   - Some modules contain duplicate migration files with similar purposes
   - Need to deduplicate and ensure proper migration order

2. **Module Registration**
   - Some modules may not be correctly registered in the application
   - Check modules_statuses.json and ensure all modules are enabled

3. **Remaining Files**
   - There may still be files in the app/ directories that need manual review
   - These files should be identified and moved to the correct modules

   - Implemented the `LeaveObserver` for general leave events
   - Added the `LeaveTypeObserver` for leave type configuration changes

2. **Notification Classes**

     - Supports multiple delivery channels (mail, database)
     - Provides context-aware messages based on the action type
     - Includes detailed leave request information
     - Uses proper email formatting with Laravel Mail Message

3. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Created factories for all models:
     - `LeaveFactory` with state modifiers (pending, approved, rejected, etc.)
     - `LeaveRequestFactory` with appropriate state methods
     - `LeaveTypeFactory` with predefined leave types
   - Added comprehensive unit tests for observers to verify notification delivery
   - Ensured proper model factory configuration with HasFactory trait

4. **Notification Workflows**
   - Implemented hierarchical notification routing (manager, department head, HR)
   - Added status change notifications for employees
   - Created deletion notifications for relevant parties
