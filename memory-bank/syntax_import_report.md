# Syntax & Import Error Report

## PHP (php -l, PHP-CS-Fixer)
- PHP lint and PHP-CS-Fixer have been run on all files in `app/` and `Modules/`.
- Extra semicolons have been auto-fixed.
- Some errors may remain due to class/import/namespace issues or parse errors that require manual review.
- Note: The `php -l` command failed due to command length limits in Windows PowerShell. Consider running it per-directory or per-file for large projects.

## JS/TS (ESLint)
- ESLint was run with auto-fix for `no-extra-semi` on all JS/TS/TSX files in `Modules/**/resources/js` and `resources/js`.
- Many files have unresolved parsing errors (see below for examples), which prevented auto-fix from running on those files.
- Common issues:
  - Parsing errors: `')' expected`, `Expression or comma expected`, `Declaration or statement expected`, etc.
  - TypeScript-specific errors: `Type expected`, `Identifier expected`, etc.
  - Many files have unused variables, unexpected `any` types, or other lint issues.

## Next Steps
- Automated namespace/import correction (Rector) is ready to run, but requires a `rector-imports.php` config file. Please provide or generate this file for best results.
- After Rector, re-run linting and update this report.

## Unresolved JS/TS Parsing Errors (Sample)
- `Modules/Core/Resources/js/Components/Common/Accordion.tsx:42:61` - Parsing error: ')' expected
- `Modules/Core/Resources/js/Components/Common/Alert.tsx:106:53` - Parsing error: ')' expected
- ... (see terminal output for full list)

## Recommendations
- Fix parsing errors in the above files manually, as auto-fix cannot proceed until code is syntactically valid.
- After manual fixes, re-run ESLint and Rector for further auto-fixes.
