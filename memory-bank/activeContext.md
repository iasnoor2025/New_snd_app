### Previous Implementation: TimesheetManagement Geofencing System Completion

We have successfully completed the comprehensive implementation of the Geofencing System within the TimesheetManagement module:

1. **Service Provider Registration**: Fixed missing `GeofencingServiceProvider` registration in `TimesheetManagementServiceProvider` to ensure all geofencing services, commands, and middleware are properly loaded
2. **Code Organization**: Created organized structure with component exports (`index.ts`), consolidated TypeScript interfaces (`geofencing.ts`), and centralized API services (`geofencingApi.ts`)
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Built complete test suites including `GeofencingServiceTest.php` for unit testing core logic and `GeofenceControllerTest.php` for API endpoint testing

3. **Testing Infrastructure**: Built complete factory classes for `LeaveType`, `Leave`, and `LeaveBalance` with various states for comprehensive testing
4. **Permission System Integration**: Updated the permission seeder with all necessary leave management permissions
5. **Leave Types Management**: Completed CRUD operations and Show component for leave type details

### Previous Implementation: Project Resource Management Fix

We have successfully resolved critical issues in the Project Resource Management system:

1. **Frontend Validation Fix**: Updated `ResourceForm.tsx` to ensure proper data validation and submission using `finalSubmissionData` instead of raw `formData`
2. **Backend Service Architecture**: Created `ProjectResourceService.php` in `app/Services/` to handle cross-module resource operations
3. **Dependency Injection Fix**: Restored proper dependency injection in both `ProjectResourceController.php` and `ProjectResourcesApiController.php`

### Modular Architecture with Domain-Driven Structure

The application uses Laravel Modules for organizing code into self-contained, domain-specific modules. Each module follows a consistent structure:

- **Domain Models** - Core business entities
- **Controllers and Requests** - HTTP layer and validation
- **Actions** - Single-purpose business operations
- **Events and Listeners** - Event-driven architecture
- **Jobs** - Background processing
- **Queries** - Specialized data retrieval
- **Repositories** - Data access layer
- **Services** - Business logic orchestration

### Service Organization Pattern

Services are organized in two ways:
- **Module-specific services**: Located in `Modules/{ModuleName}/Services/`
- **Cross-module services**: Located in `app/Services/` for shared functionality

Example: `ProjectResourceService` handles resource operations across multiple modules and is placed in `app/Services/`.

## Implementation Approach

We'll implement the system following these principles:

1. **Modular Design**
   - Each feature in its own module
   - Clear interfaces between modules
   - Self-contained business logic
   - Domain-driven structure

2. **Type Safety**
   - TypeScript for frontend
   - Strong typing in PHP
   - DTOs for data transfer
   - Schema validation for forms

3. **Service-Repository Pattern**
   - Services for business logic
   - Repositories for data access
   - Clean separation of concerns
   - Testable components

4. **Integration Strategy**
   - Inertia.js for seamless frontend/backend
   - API endpoints for CRUD operations
   - Event-driven for side effects
   - Activity logging for auditing

5. **Testing Approach**
   - Unit tests for core business logic
   - Feature tests for API endpoints
   - UI tests for critical workflows
   - Test factories for consistent data

## Next Steps

We need to begin by:

1. First implementing the core Employee Management module:
   - Create migration for employee profiles
   - Build basic CRUD operations
   - Implement document management
   - Set up role-based permissions

2. Then integrate the Timesheet system:
   - Design database schema for timesheets
   - Create timesheet entry functionality
   - Build approval workflow
   - Connect to projects module

3. Finally implement the Payroll calculation:
   - Build salary calculation service
   - Implement overtime processing
   - Create prorated calculation logic
   - Develop reporting system

After these core components are in place, we can implement the advance salary, final settlement, equipment rental, and project management features.

## Technical Debt and Notes

- We should ensure proper validation for all form inputs
- The salary calculation needs to handle various edge cases
- We need to test RTL layout thoroughly across all components
- Consider optimization strategies for reporting on large datasets
- Need to implement proper caching for translation strings
- Module interactions need to be clearly defined to prevent circular dependencies
- API versioning strategy needs to be established early

## Active Decisions
1. Using ShadCN UI for consistent component design
2. Implementing Service-Repository pattern for business logic
3. Using TypeScript for type safety in frontend
4. Following modular architecture for better maintainability
5. Implementing Zod schemas for form validation
6. Using Spatie Translatable for multilingual support
7. Integrating document management with Spatie MediaLibrary
8. Adopting domain-driven module structure
9. Using the action pattern for single-purpose business operations

## Current Considerations
1. Performance optimization for large datasets
2. Security for sensitive HR data
3. Handling of complex payroll edge cases
4. Testing strategy for multi-language support
5. Deployment process with language assets
6. Mobile responsiveness for field workers
7. Offline capabilities for remote use cases
8. Integration between modules while maintaining clear boundaries
9. Cross-module reporting capabilities
10. Audit logging strategy across modules

## Recent Changes
- Analyzed requirements for a comprehensive modular system
- Updated system patterns documentation with detailed module structure
- Identified key modules and their components
- Planned integration with existing architecture
- Prepared implementation roadmap for remaining modules
- Defined clear module boundaries and responsibilities

## Next Steps
1. Employee Management Module
   - Create database migrations
   - Implement employee model
   - Build document management
   - Develop frontend components

2. Timesheet System
   - Design database schema
   - Create timesheet entry UI
   - Implement approval workflow
   - Connect to projects module

3. Salary Calculation
   - Implement calculation service
   - Build overtime processing
   - Create prorated calculations
   - Develop reporting functionality

4. UI/UX Implementation
   - Configure ShadCN UI components
   - Implement responsive layouts
   - Create form validation schema
   - Design dashboard views

## Recent Change: Unified Module Routing

- All module web routes are now wrapped in the correct `Route::prefix()` and `->name()` group as per the new convention (see systemPatterns.md for mapping).
- Each module's ServiceProvider loads its web.php using `$this->loadRoutesFrom(...)`.
- Ziggy manifest regenerated, route/config/view caches cleared and rebuilt.
- This resolves the 404/403/500 errors for module endpoints and brings all modules into routing alignment for Inertia.js and Ziggy.
